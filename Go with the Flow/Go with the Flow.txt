In typesetting, a “river” is a string of spaces formed by gaps between words that extends down several lines of text.
For instance, Figure 1 shows several examples of rivers highlighted in red (text is intentionally blurred to make the rivers more visible).
Celebrated river authority Flo Ng wants her new book on rivers of the world to include the longest typographic rivers possible.
